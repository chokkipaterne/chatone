# chatone
A Q&amp;A system leveraging LLMs (like GPT4ALL, LLAMA, GPT3, GPT4) for queries across diverse formats including csv, xls, pdf, web pages, and YouTube videos

## How to use
1. Enter your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) ðŸ”‘
2. Upload your data on various document formats such as csv, xls, txt, pdf, eml, pptx, website page, and even YouTube video ðŸ“„
3. Select the data on which you want to chat withðŸ’¬

## How does ChatOne operate?
When you upload a document, it gets segmented into smaller sections and is stored within a specialized database termed a vector index. This index facilitates semantic search and retrieval.
When a query is posed, ChatOne scours through the document segments, identifying the most pertinent ones using the vector index. Subsequently, it employs tools like GPT-3 to generate a conclusive response.

## Why does document indexing take a significant amount of time?
The duration required for document indexing can be extended if you're using a free OpenAI API key. This is due to the stringent rate limits placed on free API keys. To expedite the indexing process, utilizing a paid API key is recommended.

## Are the provided answers completely accurate?
No, the responses are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate. ChatOne utilizes resources like GPT-3 to craft answers. While GPT-3 is a robust language model, it can still exhibit errors and tendencies toward producing imaginative content (hallucinations). 
However, for the majority of scenarios, ChatOne boasts a high level of accuracy and can address a wide array of questions. It's advisable to cross-reference answers with authoritative sources to confirm their correctness.
